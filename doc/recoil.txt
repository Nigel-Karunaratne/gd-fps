Camera and Bloom

Bloom:
	You fire, it adds a set float to the bloom counter var (+= value) after firing (so first shot can be accurate)
	If not firing (i.e. every frame), remove some from the counter var

Camera:
	minimal vertical recoil (+ horizontal?)
	larger for semi-auto, smaller for auto
	again, have this be a variable

Auto weapons have have more bloom growth, less recoil
Semi-Auto weapons have more recoil, less bloom growth
