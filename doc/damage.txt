THE BASE UNIT FOR ALL DAMAGE IS AN INT VALUE OF 10

ALL DAMAGE/HP VALUES ARE IN INTEGERS

WHEN DISPLAYED TO THE USER, TEH DAMAGE VALUES SHOULD BE DIVIDED BY 10 TO PRODUCE A FLOAT

EX:
	ENEMY HAS 50 HP
	PLAYER DOES CRITICAL DAMAGE TO IT (1.5x MULTIPLER), BASE DAMAGE IS 10
	SO PLAYER ENDS UP DOING 10 * 1.5 = 15 DAMAGE
	THIS IS DISPLAYED AS "1.5" DAMAGE BY THE PLAYER, ENEMY IS SHOWN TO HAVE "5" HP
