perks:

rapid fire (increase rpm)
big mag (increase magazine size)
stable/sharp (little to no recoil/bloom?)
quick load (quick reloading)

energy (projectile instead of hitscan, does more damage)


ice (slow down target's firing speed)
fire (applies fire, does small damage over time. cannot be re-applied?)
charge (damage is lower but hits build a charge, invisible to player? after charge hits 10x stacks, deals big damage. little damage hits + 1 large damage must be > base damage)
